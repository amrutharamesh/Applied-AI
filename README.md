# Applied-AI
This contains all the projects I did for UIC CS 514 - Applied Artificial Intelligence during Fall 2016. Each of the projects have their own ReadMe and specify how to run them and understand them. 

All the projects are based on my original ideas I developed for each project's requirement.
